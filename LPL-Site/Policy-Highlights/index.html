          <p id="accordian-a" aria-expanded="false" class="collapse">In the event that an outstanding fee remains unpaid by a client, instead of suing for fees, which may result in a counter suit for malpractice, the Attorneys’ Preferred policy will allow for one fee, up to $5,000, to be reimbursed from the carrier. With the average US LPL claim at about $75,000, this could potentially protect the firm’s reputation from the negative impact of a counter claim for malpractice.

          <p id="accordian-b" aria-expanded="false" class="collapse">
              The carrier will never settle a claim on your behalf, without your consent. USI Affinity understands that your reputation is a valuable asset and we want to help you to protect it. Should you choose to fight a claim that you believe has no merit, you will not be responsible to cover the difference between the proposed settlement amount and actual amount, should the claim be settled against you.

              In the event that you have to make a court appearance to fight a claim, you are entitled to recoup those billable hours lost. USI Affinity negotiated with the carrier for reimbursement of $500 per day, up to a maximum of $25,000 per claim, regardless of the number of insureds or days in attendance, or the number of trials. $50,000 aggregate. Reimbursement not subject to deductible.
