      <p id="accordian-a" aria-expanded="false" class="collapse">In the event that an outstanding fee remains unpaid by a client, instead of suing for fees, which may result in a counter suit for malpractice, the Attorneys’ Preferred policy will allow for one fee, up to $5,000, to be reimbursed from the carrier. With the average US LPL claim at about $75,000, this could potentially protect the firm’s reputation from the negative impact of a counter claim for malpractice.

              <p>Lawyers' Professional Liability coverage helps protect New York law firms from costly legal malpractice lawsuits.
                Law firms that do not carry this legal liability coverage leave themselves open to a host of lawsuit possibilities,
                the most common being:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Malpractice (a former client unhappy with the service or judgments they received).</li>
                <li>Suits that may arise out of a former client's assertion that the bill is too high, unjust or, more commonly,
                  overdue.

            <div id="accordian-b" class="faq-answer collapse" aria-expanded="false">
              <p>If you already have lawyers' professional liability coverage, it's advisable that you look at two key features
                of your Bar Association's plan: Lateral Hire Coverage and Special Benefits for Sole Practitioners. </p>

              <p>With Lateral Hire Coverage, attorneys who join your firm will be covered for their prior acts, provided 1)
                they meet the terms and conditions of the policy and are subject to underwriting approval; and 2) have maintained
                continuous claims-made coverage while in practice. (This coverage may be excluded from the policy upon your
                law firm's written request.) </p>

              <p>And Special Benefits for Sole Practitioners include the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Part-Time Program </li>

            <div id="accordian-d" class="faq-answer collapse" aria-expanded="false">
              <p>Professional Liability insurance policies are written on a claims-made and reported basis. This means that
                the policy that is in force at the time a claim is made and reported, rather than when the error or omission
                is committed, is the policy that will respond. Due to the nature of professional services, there can be many
                years between the time an error or omission happens and discovery. This allows rates to be set more in accordance
                with what is currently happening with claims in the profession. Your policy may cover all activities since
                your firm began, or may have prior acts dates that limit coverage to more recent events for the firm or certain
                attorneys. The following are some of the rating factors that affect your premium.</p>

            <p class="faq-question list-title collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" data-target="#accordian-e">What are the different factors that affect your premium?</p>
            <div id="accordian-e" class="faq-answer collapse" aria-expanded="false">
              <ul>
                <li>Step Rating - Claims-made and reported policies offer a credit for the first several years of coverage. Because
                  services rendered in the first year of practice don't pose huge risk, these credits can help offset some
                  premium costs. As the policy continues to renew each year, another year of exposure is added and the amount
                  of credit available is reduced accordingly. The credit is eliminated entirely usually around the sixth
                  year. Don't forget, your claims-made and reported policy covers accumulated years of practice in an ever
                  widening window of exposure.</li>
                <li>Your Area of Practice - Certain areas of legal practice are exposed to more claims than others due to the
                  nature of the work and client profile. Additionally, due to changes in the legal or economic climate, an
                  area of practice that has traditionally been low risk can become volatile and begin to generate heightened
                  claim activity. It is important to be clear on your areas of practice and classify these areas accurately
                  on your application materials. The percentage of time you spend in any given area is also important. </li>
                <li>Your Attorney Roster - Your premium is also impacted by the attorneys working for your firm. Full time, long
                  term attorneys generate the highest premium. The premium for newly hired attorneys generate credited premium
                  because of step rating. Part time attorneys and Of Counsel attorneys also generally benefit from reduced
                  premiums. </li>
                <li>Claims &#38; Risk Management - There is no doubt that claims not only affect your premium, but your insurability
                  as well. It is best to avoid them altogether and to minimize those that do happen. Frequent small claims
                  and singular large claims can lead to increased premiums or a non-renewal of your insurance. The frequency
                  of claims is often can be more problematic than one large one. Understanding and implementing certain practice
                  management tools can prevent claims and make some easier to have dismissed. Engagement letters, computerized
                  docket systems, client selection and fee collection protocols are as simple as seat belts and smoke detectors
                  in minimizing or perhaps preventing loss.</li>
                <li>Credits - How can you reduce your premium? As an NYSBA member, a 5% Bar Association membership credit can
                  will be applied to your Lawyers' Professional Liability Policy premium for membership in the New York State
                  Bar Association, on a per-attorney basis. Additionally, a 7.5% risk control credit can be applied, per
                  attorney for two years after completing a qualifying CNA risk management seminar. More information on these
                  credits can be found on CNA's website at )
