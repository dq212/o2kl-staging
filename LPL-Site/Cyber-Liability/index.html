          Not all data breaches are malicious cyber attacks. A breach can be an employee error or even an internal system error. However,

        <p>While LPL insurance affords some coverage for cyber liability risks, there are limitations to the coverage provided
          by a law firm’s LPL policy. However, to trigger coverage under the law firm’s LPL policy, there must be an alleged
          "wrongful act" in the conduct of legal services (usually a negligence trigger). Law firms could, however, be liable
          for data or network security breaches even in the absence of a wrongful act, and the incident will not always be
          in connection with the provision of legal services for others (e.g., a breach of employee information).</p>

        <p>Shifting your coverage to a dedicated Cyber Liability insurance policy offers several distinct advantages. Additionally,
          a dedicated Cyber Liability Insurance Policy helps not only in response to a breach, but in prevention of one as
          well.</p>

        <h4>Cyber Risks For Law Firms</h4>
        <p>The reality is, in today’s business world, the question is no longer "if," the question is "when". When will your
          firm be the victim of a breach?
